# Micro Design (MD)
it doesn't sound like what it is in our design process  , don't get me wrong...we design in small scale but the main idea to make it look like it is a micro design, is the way we show it to people.
the most common example that has a lot of examples about MD is Nature ! 

well , in case you didn't know what we are talking about , hold something in your hand (flower , pen ,  cloth , ...etc) , and try to have the most closer look , what you will see ? ...not too much , right?
because your eyes have limit for what they can see...obviously !
but if have a microscope or good camera with strong lens you will be able to see new worlds.

* In our previous examples ,there are many properties in common, and it is these properties that make our objects look like infinitesimal and are not visible to the naked eye , and they are :
1) **Mono and bi-color**
2) **Isolated and non-isolated areas**
3) **Pattern**
4) **Info**

## Mono and bi-color :
![both](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53704509/82732151-1d051300-9d14-11ea-898f-e7bebe1be0b7.jpg)

Mono and bi-color property, depends on the presence of a closed field with two color ends , as all colors are gradations of these two colors only , in short, the observer will see only two dominant colors or sometimes only one color.

## Isolated and non-isolated areas :
![test 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53704509/82733326-c26fb500-9d1b-11ea-855a-124ab7ba1012.jpg)
![test 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53704509/82734340-19c55380-9d23-11ea-9d6f-f003be7d88d0.jpg)

In our previous examples, you will notice the images with two regions in red and blue.
**Red** represents the **non-isolated area** containing the prominent details of the shape.
**Blue**  represents the **isolated area** that does not contain anything, it plays an important role in the appearance of the figure and making it clear and sometimes it contains objects that can be blurred out through the camera lens.

## Pattern:

![pattern1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53704509/82745055-94748a00-9d88-11ea-8be8-97d25ea96057.jpg)
Microscopic bodies are characterized by the presence of patterns in their design, and this is one of the absolute things, the pattern may be in design and may be in the raw material, and the pattern may be in the way the objects are distributed .
Where in the previous example we see that the pattern is in the design itself .
Patterns can be classified into two types:
**Simple**: it does not contain any details
**Complicated**: Contains details that may be randomness in distribution or engineering uniformity.

**Simple pattern in the design itself**

## Info:
**This is the most powerful one !** 
When someone wants to show you a design and before he does that , he gives an info that this design that about to show you is on **Micro Scale** !
are you shocked ? 
For ex :
*  **The figure on the left is an optical microscope image of glue balls. The second figure from left is a scanning ion secondary electron image of the glue balls. The two figures on the right are the scanning ion secondary electron images before and after adhesion of the substrate to the glue ball** (talking about Spider cells)

and of course there are cases where you can't tell if it is MD or not  ,cause sometimes small is look like it is big , and this is normal.

* Now we can use those properties to create our own MD !
* I built MD pre-form **Web** for what I explained try to use it .
